                            <p>Born into a family lineage steeped in business acumen spanning three generations on my mother's side, and with a father hailing from a distinguished background, it might have seemed natural for me to follow the path of commerce. However, fate had other plans, woven intricately with threads of courage, strength, and a profound sense of purpose.</p>

                            <p>My father's journey stands as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Despite being born into noble lineage, he charted a different course, driven by an unwavering commitment to healing.
                                In an era marred by formidable challenges in paediatric healthcare in India, marked by scarce resources, crumbling infrastructure, and a dearth of specialised medical professionals, he emerged as a beacon of hope to anyone who knew him.</p>

                        <p>By the 1980s, a time when paediatric healthcare in India was grappling with monumental hurdles, my father defied the odds. Armed with determination and a thirst for knowledge, he pursued not one but two postgraduate degrees, both specialising in paediatrics. His decision to dedicate his life to paediatric care was not merely a career choice; it was a calling, a response to the pressing healthcare needs of our nation.</p>

                        <p>These contrasting worlds shaped my worldview, instilling in me a deep appreciation for the power of entrepreneurship to transform lives and an acute understanding of the pressing healthcare needs of our time. It was this duality that ignited within me a sense of purpose, driving me to bridge the gap between business and healthcare, to harness the potential of both realms for the betterment of society.</p>
                        <p>Growing up in such an environment, I was blessed with a unique perspective. On one hand, I witnessed the fruits of successful business endeavours, learning valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and perseverance. On the other hand, I was keenly aware of the stark realities plaguing our healthcare system, where lives hung in the balance today more due to improper resource management rather than inadequate resources and a shortage of skilled professionals - <i>the healthcare situation has significantly changed between my fathers time & mine.</i></p>

Counting nothing short from Acha & Amma, the caring & love I got from my maternal grandparents & the attachment I had with them was nothing short the definition of parents. I believe this is a special blessing the heavens have given me. I got to live 10,830 precious days with my grandpa and 12,837 magical days with my grandma - which I only wish I could relive them a million times over & again...</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify !important;">Diabetes, in its simplest terms, is a condition where blood glucose levels are too high. So, keeping glucose levels in check should eliminate any related issues, right? Complications should stem mostly from long-term effects of diabetic medications rather than high blood sugar levels... right?
                                        Yet, sadly, this wasn't the case for my grandmother. Despite maintaining normal sugar levels, drastically restricting her favourite foods, and being an ideal patient for three decades, she struggled with her health, faced numerous difficulties was never satisfied in overall quality of her life after becoming diabetic. It became clear to me that there was something profound connected to her diabetes, causing these complications, something we were overlooking or not addressing.</p>

                                    <p>In the intricate realm of healthcare, I've transitioned from a seasoned medical practitioner to a visionary clinical researcher and devoted social entrepreneur specialising in diabetology. Driven by a profound mission, I'm committed to reshaping the landscape of diabetes care, from conventional glucose-centric management towards a insulin-centric paradigm.

                                    <p>In the early 1900s the biggest medical cause for lose of human life were infections, maternal mortality, infant mortality, cardiovascular diseases like rheumatic heart diseases (infectious in origin - quite different from what we see today), Malnutrition and starvation.</p>
                                    <p>This landscape has undergone a significant transformation since then. There has been a paradigm shift to this. Today, the younger generation doesn't encounter these historical challenges as their primary health concerns. Instead, we now grapple with a different set of formidable adversaries: coronary vascular diseases, cancer, Type I Diabetes, Alzheimer's, obesity, and infertility. These are the health issues that increasingly define the 21st century.</p>
